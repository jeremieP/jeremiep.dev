# jeremieP.dev - Portfolio

This is my simple portfolio website, using Astro and the starter kit ["Portfolio"](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/latest/examples/portfolio).

It will be my sandbox for a lot of things

Objectives : 
- Having a simple page to introduce myself
- Write blog posts
- Share my Twitch activities
- Share my Playstation trophies

Let's have fun and feel free to follow me on [Twitter (X)](https://twitter.com/jeremieP) or [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/jeremieP_) !

This website will be deployed on Vercel, on [www.jeremiep.dev](https://www.jeremiep.dev)
